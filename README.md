# FPGA_Stopwatch

FPGA(Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a type of integrated circuit that allows the user to be configured after manufacture. It is build from various programmable logic blocks  that allows creating custom digital circuits which makes them very flexible and suitable for wide range of applications.

The aim of this project is to create full operating stopwatch module on DE10-Lite Board, that counts the time and display it on inbuilt seven segment display and allows user to interact with it using buttons and switch based on MAX10 FPGA architecture. Whole module consist of some sub-modules like clock divider, stopwatch logic, binary to seven segment encoder organised in top-level design. User interface is capable of performing start/stop, hold and reset function.

The learning outcome is to gain deeper understanding of FPGA architecture, sequential and structural logic as well as some practical experience of coding in Verilog language. Project focuses on importance of testing and checking correct behaviour of each designed module and combining them all together to create working top-level design structure. Another thing that this project provide is the skill of implementing designed code onto the physical board and manual interaction with the inputs and outputs of the design.
